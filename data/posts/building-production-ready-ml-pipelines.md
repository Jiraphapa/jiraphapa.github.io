Moving machine learning models from notebooks to production requires robust infrastructure, automation, and monitoring. MLOps practices bridge the gap between data science experimentation and reliable, scalable ML systems.

## MLOps Fundamentals

- Feature Stores: Centralize feature engineering for consistency across training and serving.
- Model Registry: Version and track models with metadata and lineage information.
- Automated Training: Implement continuous training pipelines triggered by data or schedule.
- Model Serving: Deploy models with auto-scaling and A/B testing capabilities.

## Production Considerations

- Data Validation: Detect data drift and schema changes before they impact models.
- Model Monitoring: Track prediction quality and performance metrics in production.
- Reproducibility: Ensure experiments and training runs can be reproduced exactly.
- Cost Optimization: Optimize compute resources for training and inference workloads.
