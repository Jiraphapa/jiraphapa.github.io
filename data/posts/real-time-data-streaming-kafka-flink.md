Real-time data processing has become essential for modern applications requiring immediate insights and actions. Apache Kafka and Flink together provide a powerful platform for building streaming pipelines that can handle massive scale with strong delivery guarantees.

## Streaming Architecture

- Kafka Topics Design: Structure topics for optimal partitioning and consumer scalability.
- Flink Job Patterns: Implement windowing, joins, and aggregations for stream processing.
- Exactly-Once Semantics: Configure end-to-end exactly-once processing guarantees.
- State Management: Leverage Flink's state backends for fault-tolerant processing.

## Operational Excellence

- Backpressure Handling: Design systems that gracefully handle processing slowdowns.
- Schema Registry: Manage schema evolution for streaming data contracts.
- Monitoring & Alerting: Track lag, throughput, and processing latency metrics.
- Disaster Recovery: Implement checkpointing and recovery strategies.
