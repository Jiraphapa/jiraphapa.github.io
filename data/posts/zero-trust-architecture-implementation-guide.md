Zero Trust is not just a buzzword—it's a fundamental shift in security architecture that assumes no implicit trust. In today's landscape of sophisticated threats and distributed workforces, implementing Zero Trust is essential for protecting critical assets.

## Zero Trust Principles

- Verify Explicitly: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.
- Least Privilege Access: Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access policies.
- Assume Breach: Minimize blast radius and segment access to limit lateral movement.
- Continuous Validation: Re-evaluate trust continuously throughout every session.

## Implementation Roadmap

- Identity Foundation: Establish strong identity verification with MFA and SSO.
- Network Segmentation: Implement micro-segmentation and software-defined perimeters.
- Device Trust: Ensure device health and compliance before granting access.
- Data Protection: Classify data and apply appropriate encryption and access controls.
